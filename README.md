This is from a course I am taking on Udemy called "Become a WordPress Developer: Unlocking Power With Code" by @LearnWebCode

The udemy course is located at https://www.udemy.com/share/1000FwB0UbdFZXRHw=/

I am using git for this project, and I am using the book "Pro Git" as a reference. I found the book here https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2

Working on merging - changing this to see on master. Deleting old project and starting over.
